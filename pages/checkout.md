## Daily Cpp Interview Pro

__Every day, you will receive a either__
* A theoretical C++ question or a coding problem
* A detailed answer written by Sandor, a senior C++ engineer, blogger, conference speaker
* You'll receive all the previous solution
* You can cancel anytime

These question or similar have been already asked at real C++ interviews by tech companies. Practicing by the help of these questions and exercises will help you prepare for your next interviews.

Happy learning!
